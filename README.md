GitGud Food Park Ordering & Management System

Is a responsive web application that brings together park owners, stall owners, and customers on a single platform: park owners oversee the entire venue by approving and onboarding new food stalls; stall owners log in to configure and update their digital menus, manage incoming orders in real time, and review detailed sales and revenue reports; customers browse a searchable, filterable marketplace of food stalls, add items with custom notes to a cart, choose from multiple secure payment options, and track their order’s status via a live progress bar. Built with a Bootstrap 5 front end, AJAX-driven interactivity, a MySQL back end, and Composer‐managed PHP dependencies, the system ensures a seamless ordering experience and efficient back-of-house operations in any food park setting.
